# Existing Patient

An existing patient has previously received treatment, and their information is stored in the Unite EMR, linked to a unique PIN. Front desk staff can quickly access this data using identifiers like the Patient PIN/Name/Emirates ID/Mobile number, or directly through the Emirates ID card. This streamlined process ensures easy appointment management for returning patients.
