# Using Emirates ID

The Emirates Identity Card is an official government-issued identification card in the United Arab Emirates. The Unite EMR application integrates with card readers, enabling front desk staff to automatically retrieve and input data directly from the Emirates ID card. This feature streamlines the registration process, saving time and reducing the risk of manual entry errors.

**Steps to book an appointment using Emirates ID for New or Existing Patient**
