# Waiting List Management

The **Waiting List** feature in Unite EMR allows staff to manage patients awaiting appointment slots. By default, in the [Scheduler ](../)screen, the waiting list section will be open. This section lies below the Date Calendar. In the toolbar, toggle the **Calendar & Waiting List** <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Vector (2).svg" alt="" data-size="original"> icon to show or hide the Calendar and Waiting List sections. The transactions/entries are listed as cards. Each card will include details such as the patient's name, preferred date and time, preferred doctor, and the department of the preferred doctor. Users can [add](add.md), [edit](edit-delete-filter.md), [move](move.md), and [delete ](edit-delete-filter.md)appointments on the waiting list.

The Waiting List transaction/entries will remain in the queue, regardless of date and time, until it has been moved to an Appointment slot.
